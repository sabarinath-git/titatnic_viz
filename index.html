          <p class="lead">
            According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic"> Wikipedia, </a>
            in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, in North Atlantic, the British passenger ship <b>RMS Titanic </b> met a tragic end. She sank after striking an 
            iceberg. There were 2,224 passengers and crew aboard and more than 1500 died. <br> <br>

            Most of us have heard of chivalry,the courage and valor exhibited by people on board. Does the hard fact support this?
            Today, let us take a look a small curated dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hesh97/titanicdataset-traincsv"> Kaggle </a> and see if there were any category of passengers that fared better. 
            <br> <br>

            Note that there were 714 passengers with valid datapoints for the purpose of this study, i.e. about 32% of the total estimated passengers who were on the deck of Titanic</p>
